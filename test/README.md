## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, such as:

- **Providers**: Testing state management logic
- **Repositories**: Testing data access and persistence
- **Services**: Testing business logic and external service interactions
- **Models**: Testing model behavior and validation

Unit tests use mocks to isolate the component being tested from its dependencies.

### Widget Tests

Widget tests focus on testing UI components and their interactions:

- **Screens**: Testing complete screens and their behavior
- **Dialogs**: Testing dialog behavior and user interactions
- **Components**: Testing reusable UI components

Widget tests use mock providers and services to isolate the UI from backend logic.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests focus on testing complete user flows:

- **Preset Management**: Creating, editing, and deleting presets
- **Settings Management**: Changing language, theme, and other settings
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Connecting to and managing Bluetooth devices

## Special Considerations

### Bluetooth Testing

Bluetooth functionality is tested using mock method channels to simulate platform-specific behavior. This approach allows us to test Bluetooth-related code without requiring actual Bluetooth hardware.

### Localization Testing

Localization is tested by:

1. Unit testing the `LanguageProvider` to ensure it correctly manages language preferences
2. Widget testing UI components with mock localizations to verify they display correctly in different languages
3. Integration testing language switching to verify the app correctly changes language at runtime

### Theme Testing

Theme switching is tested by:

1. Unit testing the `ThemeProvider` to ensure it correctly manages theme preferences
2. Widget testing UI components to verify they adapt correctly to different themes
3. Integration testing theme switching to verify the app correctly changes theme at runtime

## Running Tests

### Unit and Widget Tests

```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
flutter test integration_test
```

## Test Coverage

To generate test coverage reports:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

Then open `coverage/html/index.html` in a browser to view the coverage report.

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on each pull request and push to the main branch using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/flutter.yml`.

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Follow the AAA pattern in tests
4. **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocks to isolate the component being tested
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for error conditions and edge cases
6. **Keep Tests Fast**: Tests should run quickly to provide fast feedback
